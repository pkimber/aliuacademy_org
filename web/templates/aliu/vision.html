    Our vision at ALIU ACADEMY is to use technology to spread
    education across Africa and other parts of the world because
    we believe in the words of Nelson Mandela that "Education is
    the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.
    It is the great engine of personal development. It is through
    education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor,
    that a son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine,
    that a child of farm workers can become the president of a
    great nation.
